# WAVEFRONT

### A View Layer Engine For Advanced DOM Manipulations

##### Declarative Templates *|* Automatically Referenced Elements *|* DOM Helpers


#### Why
Wavefront allows you to: 
- create HTML as template literal strings
- Include other strings, elements or arrays (of either) as template tags
- Separate presentation and logic (view / controller paired architecture) 
- Define any component with a hidden name attribute 
- Reference any named component anywhere in the application
- Use DOM helpers that allow you to create applications without the limitations of Virtual-DOM implementations
- Render directly to the DOM without caching or extra overhead

__ 
### Separation of Concerns
**Wavefront in essence is a view-layer library, design pattern and a discipline based on ES6 and first-class functions**. It uses the concept of **_Declarative Templates_** to separate logic from presentation. Build application logic however you prefer providing there is no explicit logic within your templates. 
___
### Ultra-fast
**Wavefront was designed to build real world websites and web applications not theoretical benchmarks challenges**.
___
### A Comprehensive DOM Solution
- _Abstract from the DOM_ TBA
- _Render to the DOM_
- _DOM helper functions_
- _Statically generate HTML per build (As a SSR Alternative)_ TBA
___
### No Vendor Lock-In
Migration and vendor lock-in are expensive aspects of front-end development. wavefront-migration converts _Declarative Templates_ into HTML not only to escape lock-in but in case you have built Wavefront SPA interfaces you would like to later migrate to HTML.
