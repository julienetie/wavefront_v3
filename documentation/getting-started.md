# Getting Started

Wavefront is a _JavaScript View-layer Framework_ which means that it's core functonalities revolve around creating interactive user interfaces. You can find out more about the API [here](#).

## What is Wavefront 
Wavefront is a tiny JavaScript view-layer framework which is split into two parts:
- [Wavefront API](#): Tools to build advanced user interfaces naively.
- [Wave Architecture](#): A design pattern with a guided structure.

## Why Wavefront
The DOM API is very powerful with a world of features to help you build rich applications. 
Popular JavaScript frameworks tend to overshadow the native API with APIs that are less capable for building "advanced user interfaces".
Wavefront take a different approach. Wavefront is mainly concerned with responsibiliteis the native DOM commonly sruggles which are:

- Creating elements visually using string templates
- Referencing elements at creation time
- Namespacing element references at creation time
- Nesting elements, templates and arrays of either synonymously
- Reading and writing to the DOM without layout trashing
- Managing common aspects of node manipulation

The core concepts of Wavefront are small and few but powerful when coupled with the native DOM API.
